\chapter{Acknowledgement}

I would first like to thank my thesis supervisors Dr. David M.J. Tax and Dr. Guido C. de Croon for the guidance throughout the project. The meetings helped me steering the thesis in the right direction while leaving enough freedom for my own choices. Any questions I could always ask.

Furthermore, I would like to thank fellow colleagues that were involved in the implementation on the \ac{MAV} and the Autonomous Drone Race. First and foremost Shuo Li for helping me with the experiments and for all the pizza we shared together. Also, Jihaio Christoph de Wagter, Simon Spronk and all the technical staff of the \ac{MAVLab}. 
 
Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents andfriends for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.
