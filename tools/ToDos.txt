#### SSD

- coordinates should be relative to anchor coordinates and normalized to image size
- variances should be incorporated

Train and check on voc

#### Models

Implement predict_batch to increase evaluation performance


#### Dataset

Create dataset where gates are more aligned with background, avoid unrealistic settings

Add the other gates

Try to make gates thicker, extend

#### Evaluation

Write Evaluator that receives file as input instead of model

#### General

Make proper test of yolo and ssd on voc data
