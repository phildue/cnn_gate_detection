	\textbf{What are the trade-off's between detection accuracy and inference time when such a detection model is applied on a micro-air vehicle?}

\todo{Different ways to address optimization: Architectural level, Conceptual Level, Operational Level}

Operational Level - Quantization:
\cite{TripathiSanDiego}, 

Architectural Level/Number of Computations:
\cite{Howard2017}, \cite{Zhang2017a}, \cite{Ghosh2017}, 
\todo{Knowledge Distillation}

Conceptual Level - Using Time domain:
\cite{Chen2018}

\todo{We choose one/two of the above because trying everything is a bit too much. So which one and why?}

\section{Experiments}

\todo{Evaluate effects on performance and accuracy}
