\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:background}
	This work addresses several fields within Computer Vision/Machine Learning research. Chapter 2 explores these areas and builds up a solid basis to carry out further research. The chapter also contains background information for readers who come from other fields.
	
	\autoref{sec:bg:object_detection} describes Object Detection. The field is concerned with finding and classifying objects within images. \autoref{sec:bg:training} investigates methods to train models when limited data is available. \autoref{sec:bg:speed_optimization} illustrates work about increasing the inference speed of computer vision methods. \autoref{sec:bg:related_work} describes related work in the application of gate detection for autonomous drone racing.
