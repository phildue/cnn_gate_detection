\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Object detection has been an intensively studied area within computer vision. The determination of what kind of objects we see where in an image is an everyday human task, that machines still have a hard time at solving.

In recent years deep learning based object detectors have been pushing state of the art results tremendously after a long time of almost no improvements. The reason anticipated to be responsible for the strong performance boost is partly the flexibility of the model but mostly the fact that the whole detection pipeline can be integrated into one model and trained end-to-end.

The hereby used \acp{CNN} are designed in such a way that lower order layers look at small regions of the image and determine the presence of simple shapes like edges corners and blobs. Higher order layers look at the activations of the lower order stages and combine the responses to more complex shapes reaching from object parts to whole objects.

One main drawback of these \acp{CNN} is the immense amount of data and computational resources required to train all their parameters. Only when faster \acp{GPU} evolved and the internet allowed the collection and annotation of large amounts of training examples the potential of \acp{CNN} could be exploited. 

Hence, the power of deep learning based object detection arises from the complexity of real-world objects that can be efficiently represented by \acp{CNN} when trained with large amounts of annotated examples.

However, there are applications where each of the above is only available to a certain extent. For example mobile phones, robots and micro-air vehicles need to exploit their resources efficiently. Firstly because saving energy allows for a longer lifetime, secondly because these systems usually have real-time constraints that can't be met when the used algorithms are too slow.

Furthermore, there are objects that don't consists of complex shapes or patterns but are built from very simple geometry. Examples for these object which we refer to as "wire frame objects" are antennas, wires, fences, cages and the like. 

This thesis studies object detection in an extrem example of the aforementioned case: Gate Detection at the IROS 2018 Autonomous Drone Race. Within this race court several coloured metal gates are placed and need to be passed one after another as fast as possible. Hence, the more lightweight the algorithm can be executed, the less computational resources are required the lighter the \ac{MAV} can be build and the more aggressive manoeuvres can be flown. On the other hand if the method is too inaccurate, the drone misses a gate and is likely to loose the race or even crash.

From the application on MAV's further issues arise: Optical effects like lense distortion or motion blur influence the image and need to be taken into account when developing algorithms for such applications.

The research question of this work is formulated as follows:

\textbf{How can we efficiently detect wire frame objects on a micro-air vehicle?}


The remaining parts of this thesis are structured as follows: \autoref{sec:background} outlines background and related work, \autoref{sec:method} describes the proposed method, \autoref{sec:evaluation} contains the  experiments that have been carried out, \autoref{sec:disc} discusses the results and formulates a conclusion.
