\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:background}
	The research question concerns several areas of Computer Vision/Machine Learning research. This chapter investigates each area to build up a solid basis for the proposed method. Also the reader shall be informed with enough background to understand this thesis.
	
	\autoref{sec:bg:object_detection} describes the field of \textbf{Object Detection} and \textbf{Pose Estimation}. The field is concerned with detecting certain objects within images and estimate their position within 3D space. \autoref{sec:bg:training} investigates methods to train models when limited data is available. \autoref{sec:bg:speed_optimization} illustrates work that implemented computationally efficient methods. \autoref{sec:bg:related_work} describes related work in the application of gate detection for autonomous drone racing.
