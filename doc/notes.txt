Speed:
Compare performance of different elements
depthwise seperable convolutions
shufflenet
wide residual networks
find parameter dependencies

Performance:
resolution? --> seems even in the low res image is enough information to get a rough estimate of the gate
depth?
width?


if effect of resolution high
    --> cropping
else
    --> coarse to fine

attention model that randomly samples and predicts bounding box for further investigation.

region proposal model with memory to propose region for the next frame
loss function should favor larger boxes than smaller, fix aspect ratio just predict scale,
scale could be trigger for specialized network
region proposal network could exploit motion blur and the like
refine network only would have to look for corners.
