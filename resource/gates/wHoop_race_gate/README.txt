# Summary

I wanted a larger diameter race gate for my buddies and me while flying our FPV quads, so I came up with the wHoop!  Each foot has the name and a cavity where you can stash weights for stability or electronics (I'm working on a ring of LEDs and the battery pack and micro controller will hide out there).

It's about 14" (369mm) across on the inside, from flat edge to flat edge.

This is a stout race gate that prints in 6 pieces (2 feet and 4 segments).  The quadrants of the hoop use dovetail joints that are a good fit.  Your mileage may vary.  You can glue it all together for the ultimate in rigidity or just slide it together and tear it down again for easy storage after race day.

I included a couple STLs I used to confirm good fit with the dovetail joints before committing to printing the hoop segments.

EDIT: I finished my follow-on project - a [sonar sensor housing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2379415) which I mounted onto my race gate to get some blinky light action when a quad runs through (but not over or around) the gate.  Super cool!

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: LulzBot
Printer: TAZ 6
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .30
Infill: 15%

Notes: 
Printed in PLA.  There's some bridging in the cavities of each foot.  I printed the feet standing up and had no problem with that bridging.  On my Taz 6 I'm just able to print two hoop quadrants at a time.  If you have a small print bed this is not the net for you!  Feel free to mesh mix or whatever if you need to add more joints to break it down further.
