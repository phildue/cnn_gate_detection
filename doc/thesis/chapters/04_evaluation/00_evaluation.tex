\todo{Explain Metrics: mAP at different iou thresholds + Number of operations}
%Metrics: mAP(at different iou scales maybe 0.3, 0.6. 0.9) + number of computations
\todo{Experiment performance over gate angle - How much can the network extrapolate?}

\todo{Influence of background/domain - How much data is needed for the network to learn a robust representation across domains/backgrounds. This should be less on a more complex object.}

\todo{Analyse which nodes are actually used}

\todo{Show how much smaller network can perform equally}

\todo{Visualize filters/ Show what does the model learn/ What do we need the deeper layers for?}

\todo{Analyse performance vs Accuracy}
%Influence of domain it should be easier to learn robust features when there are more complex patterns. Performance over training data
