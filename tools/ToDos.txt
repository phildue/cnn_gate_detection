#### SSD

Implement data augmentation
Train and check on voc

#### Models

Implement predict_batch to increase evaluation performance
Implement mAP to be printed while training

#### Dataset

Create dataset where gates are more aligned with background, avoid unrealistic settings

Add the other gates

Try to make gates thicker, extend

#### Evaluation

Write Evaluator that receives file as input instead of model

#### General

Make proper test of yolo and ssd on voc data
